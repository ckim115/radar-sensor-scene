This project is a working simulation of a vehicle radar sensor returning data from measurements on random points of static objects.
# To Run
Open 4 new terminal windows and use the source command to run ```source ~/sim_env/devel/setup.sh``` on each.
Then run each command on a different terminal window:
```
roslaunch vehicle_and_obj robot.launch
rosrun vehicle_and_obj node
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=broadcaster/cmd_vel
rosrun vehicle_and_obj listener
```
# Using the Simulation
Instructions for moving the vehicle model are given in the terminal where ```rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=broadcaster/cmd_vel``` was executed.

 PointCloud data is represented as the white marks on the static object; the green marker is there for convenience to locate the most recently measured random point.
